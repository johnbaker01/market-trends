***Growing Popularity of Sports to Promote Global Market Share of Cone Beam Computed Tomography***

The burgeoning adoption of Cone Beam Computed Tomography in dental applications emerges as the primary growth driver propelling the CBCT market forward. This surge is attributable to the technology's unparalleled ability to provide high-resolution three-dimensional images, revolutionizing diagnostic capabilities in the field of dentistry. CBCT technology offers a significant leap in precision compared to traditional imaging techniques in dentistry. By capturing detailed three-dimensional images of oral structures, including teeth, bone, and surrounding tissues, CBCT enables dentists and oral surgeons to diagnose and plan treatments with unprecedented accuracy. This is particularly crucial in complex dental procedures such as implant planning, orthodontics, and oral surgeries. According to a report, the global dental CBCT sales were valued at approximately USD 800 million in 2020.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Cone Beam Computed Tomography Market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Advancements in Imaging Technology
- Growing Applications in Orthopedics

***Challenges:***

One of the persistent challenges associated with CBCT technology is the concern over radiation exposure. While CBCT generally involves lower radiation doses compared to traditional CT scans, there is still a need for ongoing efforts to minimize radiation exposure further. Striking a balance between diagnostic accuracy and patient safety remains a critical consideration, especially in routine imaging procedures. The initial costs associated with acquiring and implementing CBCT systems can be substantial. 

The portable segment is estimated to hold 60% share of the global cone beam computed tomography market in the year 2036. The increasing demand for point-of-care imaging is a significant driver for the growth of portable Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) systems. In emergency medicine, critical care, and scenarios where immediate imaging is essential, portable CBCT systems offer a rapid and on-the-spot solution. This demand is driven by the need for quick diagnostic assessments, enabling timely decision-making in urgent medical situations. A study published in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine in 2019 reported a 30% reduction in the time taken for diagnostic imaging in emergency settings with the use of portable CBCT systems. This reduction in turnaround time is crucial in emergencies, emphasizing the positive impact of portable CBCT on point-of-care imaging. The versatility of portable CBCT systems across multiple medical specialties is a driving factor for their adoption. These systems find applications in orthopedics, interventional radiology, and dental practices. The ability to easily transport the system to different departments within a healthcare facility enhances its utility, making it a valuable tool for various diagnostic and treatment planning needs.
