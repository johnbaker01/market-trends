The emulsion segment is to garner a highest revenue by the end of 2036 by growing at a significant CAGR over the forecast period. A crucial driver for the growth of emulsions in the liquid pediatric market is the increased preference for palatable formulations, especially among pediatric patients. Emulsions offer a versatile platform for incorporating flavors, enhancing taste appeal and ensuring better acceptance by children. This is particularly important in promoting adherence to medication regimens, especially for chronic conditions. A study found that the palatability of liquid medications significantly influences pediatric adherence. Emulsions, with their ability to mask the taste of active ingredients, were associated with higher rates of medication compliance among children. This underscores the importance of palatability in driving the growth of the emulsions segment.
