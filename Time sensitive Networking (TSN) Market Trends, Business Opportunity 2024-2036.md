Research Nester’s recent market research analysis on **“[Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) Market](https://www.researchnester.com/reports/time-sensitive-networking-market/5762): Global Demand Analysis & Opportunity Outlook 2036”** delivers a detailed competitors analysis and a detailed overview of the global high tibial osteotomy plates market in terms of market segmentation by technique, material, end-use, and by region. 

***Growing Popularity of Sports to Promote Global Market Share of* Time-sensitive Networking** 

The industry size of time-sensitive networking was USD 1 Billion. This growth of the market is poised to be dominated by the growing automation of industries. For instance, over 32% of companies have at least one function that is automated in the world. Hence, with this, the need for real-time data is also growing which is why the demand for time-sensitive networking is expected to observe a surge. Furthermore, government in different nations are initiating their efforts in research and development for the enhancement of time-sensitive networking. For instance, recently, an application case for robotics using time synchronization and time-aware shaping scheduling characteristics was presented by NIST and industry researchers in a wireless time-sensitive networking situation. Therefore, this factor is also projected to influence the demand for time-sensitive networking market. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Time-sensitive Networking (TSN) Market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Growing Adoption of Deterministic Ethernet
- Rising Integration of 5G Technology

***Challenges:***

One of the main issues facing the time-sensitive networking (TSN) business is the absence of standardization. Time-sensitive applications may profit from deterministic communication capabilities offered by the TSN set of Ethernet standards. Nonetheless, consumers may experience confusion and interoperability problems due to the existence of multiple competing TSN protocols in the time-sensitive networking market. Various industry consortiums are currently developing multiple TSN standards. Although the functionality provided by all of these standards is meant to be identical, there are some minor variations in their implementation and capabilities.

The IEEE 802.1 AS segment in the time-sensitive networking (TSN) market is expected to capture the highest revenue share of about 30% during the forecast period. IEEE 802.1AS, which was initially designed to facilitate plug-and-play video and audio applications, had just been enhanced. In actuality, IEEE 802.1AS is a significant standard change that preserves backward compatibility with the old standard while addressing 5G integration requirements. Furthermore, IEEE 802.1 AS standards prioritized enhanced reliability and cost savings, two factors critical to small-area network applications. Mechanisms are used by the IEEE 802.1AS protocol to confirm that every device connected to a network is following the protocol. For instance, an Ethernet switch is not included in the carrying time if it is discovered to not operate IEEE 802.1AS. For numerous local area network applications, reliable performance is crucial, and this is what this offer. Hence, the segment is expected to observe the significant growth in the market over the forecast period.
