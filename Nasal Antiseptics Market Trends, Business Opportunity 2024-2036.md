***Growing Popularity of Sports to Promote Global Market Share of Nasal Antiseptics Market***

Antiseptic solutions are increasingly being used in pre-operative and post-operative procedures to reduce healthcare-acquired infections (HAIs) and surgical site infections (SSIs). Antimicrobial resistance and illnesses linked to healthcare have an incalculable effect on people's lives. In one of the studies conducted in 2022, it was found that the postoperative infection rate following endoscopic sinus surgery was 10%.  

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Nasal Antiseptics Market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Increased Research & Development Activities in the Antibiotics Industry
- Increasing Elderly Population Worldwide

***Challenges:***

Nasal antiseptics may cause minor to severe adverse effects. Common adverse effects include rashes, hives, itching, and blisters. Some severe adverse effects include chest or throat tightness, difficulty breathing, and mouth swelling. As a result, this issue may limit the growth of the market.

Alcohol segment for the nasal antiseptics market is anticipated to hold the largest share of 45% during the forecast period. Because alcohol-based nasal antiseptics effectively eradicate bacteria and germs from nasal passages, their use is becoming more and more common. By acting as a disinfectant, alcohol helps to lower the risk of infection and encourage good nose hygiene. Alcohol-based antiseptics are also well-known for drying quickly, which makes them practical and simple to use. The need for alcohol-based nasal antiseptics is growing as people's awareness of personal cleanliness rises. Furthermore, most people handle alcohol-based antiseptics well and don't have any irritation in their nasal passages. Furthermore, according to a report, nasal decontamination with an alcohol-based nasal antiseptic— hand sanitizer with a nose-specific formulation—is another crucial tactic used in hundreds of US hospitals. Because it targets bacteria that have the potential to cause infections at their source, this straightforward tactic works well. Therefore, these factors are propelling the growth of the segment.
