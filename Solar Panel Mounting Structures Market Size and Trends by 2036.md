***Increasing Demand for Floating Solar Panels to Promote Global Market Share of Solar Panel Mounting Structures***

The most recent trend in the market for solar panel mounting structures is the growing popularity of floating solar panels. Floating solar panels are mounted on earth-anchored floating structures such as pontoons and rafts. Because it makes it feasible to create solar power utilizing bodies of water like lakes, reservoirs, and irrigation canals, this type of solar panel installation method is becoming more and more popular, especially in countries with limited land resources. The rising demand for floating solar panels is driving up the market for solar panel mounting structures.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Solar Panel Mounting Structures market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Growing Implementation of Smart Solar Panel Mounting Systems
- Growing Need for Increased Solar Power Generation Capacity

***Challenges:***

Solar panel mounting systems must be properly planned, built, and installed for the best alignment and stability. In order to optimize energy output and keep the structures in top condition, regular maintenance is also necessary. This can be expensive and time-consuming for certain users. 

High initial installation costs and the sporadic nature of sunlight may hamper the growth of the solar panel mounting structure market.

By product, the global Solar Panel Mounting Structures market is segmented into rooftop and ground mounted. The ground mounted segment is expected to hold a share of 54% during the forecast period. For both residential and commercial structures, the rooftop panels offer the benefit of being simple to install and requiring minimal initial and ongoing upkeep. The rooftop mounting methods have a longer lifespan—an average of 20 years. Because solar panels are becoming more and more widespread in the commercial and residential sectors to meet the need for electricity, rooftop solar panels showed strong growth throughout the forecast period. Homeowners choose rooftop solar panels for sustainable energy production because of government incentives. Rooftop solar panels are also more efficient since they are higher, face direct sunlight, and are not impacted by temperature changes. 

By region, the Europe Solar Panel Mounting Structures market is expected to hold a share of 37% during the forecast period. Europe is leading the world in the transition to renewable energy, with many countries setting ambitious targets for solar power adoption, such as Germany, Spain, and Italy. As more solar power systems are constructed to meet the growing need for clean and renewable energy, the market for solar panel mounting structures is growing. A report states that by 2024, 217.80 billion KWh of power are anticipated to be produced in the solar energy sector. Thanks to developments in solar panel technology, the European market for mounting systems for solar panels is growing. Increases in solar panel longevity, efficiency, and cost have made solar power system installation and maintenance easier and more affordable.
