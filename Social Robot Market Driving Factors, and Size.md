For instance, it is expected that more than 10 million people in Japan will disappear from the workforce by the end of 2040.

The global social robot market is also estimated to grow majorly on account of the following:

- Increasing incidence of disorders
- Growing adoption of social robots in banking sector
- Rising use of social robots for elder care
- Surging use of robots in the classroom interaction for learning,

**Global Social Robot Market: Restraining Factor**

There are still in the initial age owing to the high investment requirement for the manufacture of social robots. Moreover, there is a scarcity of professionals to operate the social robots in developing nations.
