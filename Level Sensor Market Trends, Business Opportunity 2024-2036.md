***Growing Popularity of Sports to Promote Global Market Share of* Level Sensor** 

The industry size of level sensors was about USD 5 billion. The growth of the sector is set to be dominated by a rising amount of wastewater that needs to be treated Globally, over 379 billion cubic meters of municipal wastewater is generated annually. It is anticipated that the production of wastewater will increase by approximately 23% by 2030 and close to 50% by 2050. Therefore, with the growing demand for wastewater treatment the adoption of level sensors is also expected to rise. By providing operators with real-time data on wastewater volume, these sensors enable them to track the treatment process and make adjustments as needed to ensure optimal performance.Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Level Sensor Market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Growing deployment of IoT in level sensors
- Surge in adoption of level sensors in automobiles

***Challenges:***

Industry 4.0, which brought smart manufacturing processes that employ cyber-physical systems to monitor a factory's physical processes and make decentralized choices, entered the 21st century after the first three industrial revolutions in the 18th and 19th centuries.

In level sensor market, non-contact segment is poised to hold over 60% share by the end of 2036 because of the rising use of non-contact type segments. The industry is witnessing a shift from contact to non-contact type due to its superior flexibility, measurement accuracy, and reduced maintenance requirements. Since non-contact sensors don't have the mechanical moving parts of floats and probes, their basic operation puts far less strain on them.
