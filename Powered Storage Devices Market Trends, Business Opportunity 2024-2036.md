***Growing Popularity of Sports to Promote Global Market Share of* Powered Storage Devices Market**

This growth in the market revenue is set to be influenced by the growing demand for renewable energy. It is predicted that between 2022 and 2027, worldwide renewable capacity is expected to increase by almost 2 399 GW, or nearly 74%.

The primary sources of renewable energy generation are natural occurrences. For instance, hydroelectric power is contingent upon seasonal river flows, solar power is dependent upon daylight hours, and wind power is contingent upon wind constancy. Therefore, the amounts produced are erratic. As humans frequently require varying amounts of energy at different times of the day and year, the energy demand is also not consistent. Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Powered Storage Devices Market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surge in the number of power outages 
- Improvement in energy storage technologies 

***Challenges:***

The high cost of an energy storage system is one of its main disadvantages. A person may have to pay extra for your energy storage system in addition to the photovoltaic grid if they select one from a well-known and respected company. 

In powered storage devices market, batteries segment is likely to account for more than 50% share by the end of 2036. The majority of devices employ batteries because they provide a handy and transportable means of supplying and storing electrical energy. They may be designed to provide a set quantity of energy for a predetermined amount of time and are simple to incorporate into a wide range of systems and equipment.
