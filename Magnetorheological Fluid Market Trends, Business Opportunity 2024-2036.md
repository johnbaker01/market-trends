***Growing Popularity of Sports to Promote Global Market Share of* Magnetorheological Fluid** 

the industry size of magnetorheological fluid was USD 4 Billion. The market is developing as the global chemical industry grows, potentially increasing the demand for advanced materials such as magnetorheological fluid. Globally, there is widespread recognition of the chemical industry's pivotal role in facilitating economic expansion caused by several variables, including globalization, technology breakthroughs, and the rising need for chemicals across numerous industries. According to estimates, in 2024–2028, the global chemicals market is expected to expand at a rate of around 3%, reaching a market value of over USD 1 trillion.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Magnetorheological Fluid Market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Surging popularity of robotic surgery
- Growing need for magnetic resonance fluids in pneumatic prosthetic limb

***Challenges:***

Gravity may cause the magnetic particles in MR fluid to settle or silt over time, reducing the fluid's performance and homogeneity. The fluid's consistency and efficacy may be impacted by this sedimentation, necessitating re-magnetization or frequent agitation to preserve the fluid's qualities.MR fluid containing magnetic particles can erode and wear down component surfaces, especially in high-load or high-speed applications. This may result in more frequent maintenance being needed.

The hydraulic segment in the magnetorheological fluid market is expected to gain a revenue share of about 35% by the year 2036. The segment’s growth can be attributed to its many uses and high quality. Hydraulic oil is the industry leader in magnetorheological fluids. It is sometimes referred to as liquid fluid, an incompressible liquid that is widely used to power equipment and pipelines. providing compatibility and stability, which makes them appealing for MRF chemistry.
