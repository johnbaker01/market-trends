The market is experiencing a notable surge propelled by significant advancements in targeted therapies. Traditional treatment modalities such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation have shown efficacy, but the landscape is evolving with the advent of more precise and targeted approaches. Targeted therapies offer a tailored and focused attack on cancer cells, minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissues. Targeted therapies are at the forefront of a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, including retinoblastoma. These therapies are designed to identify and attack specific molecules or pathways involved in the growth and survival of cancer cells. According to a report, the global targeted therapy sales were valued at USD 136 billion in 2020.

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Retinoblastoma Treatment Market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Technological Advancements in Diagnostic Imaging
- Immunotherapy Advancements and Immunomodulatory Agents

***Challenges:***

Early detection of retinoblastoma remains a challenge due to factors such as the age of onset, limited communication in young children, and the absence of noticeable symptoms in the early stages. Delayed diagnosis may lead to advanced disease stages, reducing the effectiveness of treatment and posing a higher risk of vision loss or mortality. The availability of effective treatment options for advanced or refractory retinoblastoma cases is limited. Resistance to traditional therapies and the lack of targeted options pose significant challenges.

The surgical interventions segment in the retinoblastoma treatment market is estimated to gain the largest revenue share of 60% in the year 2036. Advancements in microsurgical techniques have significantly improved the precision and outcomes of retinoblastoma surgeries. Microsurgery allows for intricate procedures with minimal damage to surrounding healthy tissues, facilitating improved postoperative recovery and reduced complications. This statistic underscores the positive impact of technological advancements on surgical outcomes. Innovations in intraocular prosthetics contribute to the growth of the Surgical Interventions segment by addressing aesthetic and functional concerns post-enucleation.
