***Growing Popularity of Sports to Promote Global Market Share of* Real-time Operating System (RTOS)** 

The industry size of real-time operating systems was USD 7 Billion. This growth in the RTOS market revenue is set to be influenced by growing demand for automotive which is further boosting the need for automotive electronics. Global automotive sales rose from close to 65 million vehicles in 2021 to approximately 66 million vehicles in 2022. Therefore, the deployment of real-time operating systems is growing. Reliable RTOS for automotive applications is now essential due to the growing number of features on vehicles being controlled by software. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have demonstrated that immediate response to environmental events is critical for safety. 

Some of the major growth factors and challenges that are associated with the growth of the global Real-time Operating System (RTOS) Market are:

***Growth Drivers:***

- Rising Demand for Transport & Logistics 
- Surge in Adoption of IoT in Real Time Operating Systems 

***Challenges:***

Code injection is the most prevalent and harmful type of online assault. An arbitrary code is fed into and executed by a computer or real-time operating system to carry out this attack. The attackers want to take over your program, change the way commands are sent through it, and get the program to run harmful instructions. Also, memory management units are missing in several RTOSs. Similar to a board, the message-sharing platform allows individuals to post messages and get responses. 

The soft RTOS segment in the real-time operating system market is expected to gather the highest revenue share of about 50% during the forecast period. A soft real-time RTOS can withstand delays in the operating system. This sort of RTOS assigns deadlines to specific tasks yet is tolerant of brief delays. Consequently, deadlines are handled elegantly by this kind of RTOS. Furthermore, the growing trend of smart homes is also projected to influence the segment growth. For instance, globally, by 2024, customers are expected to spend over USD 92 million annually on home automation. With more and more individuals looking to automate their homes and simplify their lives, smart home technology is growing in popularity.
